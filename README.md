# Roam Alpha API ClojureScript wrapper

## Installation

Include `[org.clojars.aidam/roam-alpha-api "1.0.2"]]` in your project.

## Usage

The namespaces mirror the structure of the roamAlphaAPI JS object.

All inputs and outputs are in cljs instead of js (i.e. you don't need to do any converting).

## Example

```clojure
(ns roam-plugin.core
  [:require [roam-alpha-api.data :as d]
            [roam-alpha-api.data.block :as block]
            [roam-alpha-api.ui :refer [get-focused-block]]
            [roam-alpha-api.util :refer [generate-uid]]])

(d/q '[:find ... :where ...])
(block/create {:block {:uid "..."}})
(get-focused-block)
(generate-uid)
```
